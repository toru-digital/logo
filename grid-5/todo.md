# Idea - digital ripples

as you move the cursor around it sends ripples of stochastic movement outwards. The changes that occurs can just be that the letters flick from one to the next. But the more momentum the cursor has the more the movement, so on rest it will slowly die down. Each grid block will need a 'chaos' number that will determine how much it will move. This will be a number between 0 and 1.
